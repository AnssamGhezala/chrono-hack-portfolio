Click on a card to see it's hidden picture. Try to find another card which has the same picture as that card.

If the second card's hidden picture does not match with the first, try again 💫
If you manage to properly match all the cards, bravo! 🎉
Careful 🛑 There's a 1 card that does not matchy of the others, beware of the joker 🃏
