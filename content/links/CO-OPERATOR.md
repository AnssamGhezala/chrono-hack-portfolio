The CO-OP-ERATOR is a software system for managing co-op terms for such co-op programs. It offers different services depending on the user. The CO-OP-ERATOR enables students to register to a co-op program and track their progress, while managing submitted files such as forms, contracts, reports. The CO-OP-ERATOR also allows employers to confirm when a student has started their co-op position, submit student evaluation forms and access a proof of co-op placement and tax credit forms, while also be notified about/invited to upcoming events. The CO-OP-ERATOR gives access to the co-op administrator to submit/ modify files, view studentsâ€™ status and progress and send reminders. The CO-OP-ERATOR system also allows the co-op academic program to view the co-op internship evaluation submitted by employer or a student, course reviews, as well as make a judgement as to whether a co-op term was successfully completed or not.
