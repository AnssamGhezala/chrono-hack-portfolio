<h3>A little about me...</h3>

Hi! I'm a Software Engineering student at McGill University, graduating in May 2021 :) I like building cool things with JavaScript and React and am exploring the web dev world! I also write monthly articles on dev.to and Medium. Checkout my publications!

<br />
I like reading stuff about the web dev industry, and am curious about anything related it. Although I am currently learning the core computer science/software engineering topics at McGill, most of the web-dev related skills that I have achieved are self-taught. I love the Web and I want to be able to contribute to it, which is why I hope to get a fulltime position in front-end related positions :)
